# Spark QA PCB Inspector - Software Specification

## Purpose

This desktop application provides automated visual inspection of PCBs using a standard USB webcam. It uses AI-enhanced computer vision to compare boards to a known good sample (QA sample) and identify component placement and orientation errors.

---

## Goals

* âœ… Capture and save high-quality front and back images of a known-good PCB as a QA reference.
* âœ… Allow boards to be scanned in any orientation or rotation.
* ðŸ”„ Identify missing, rotated, or misplaced components using AI.
* âœ… Provide a modern, intuitive UI with PySide6 + dark theme.
* ðŸ”„ Generate human-readable QA reports describing defects.

---

## Core Features

### âœ… QA Reference Creation (IMPLEMENTED)

* Capture **front** and **back** images of a new PCB.
* Save images and metadata to `qa_samples/` directory.
* Record board name, date, notes, etc.
* **Smart board recognition** - automatically detects existing boards vs new ones.

### ðŸ”„ Inspection Engine (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)

* âœ… Use OpenCV to extract features from incoming webcam feed.
* âœ… Align current scan with the QA sample regardless of rotation.
* ðŸ”„ Compare regions of interest using AI (GPT-4 Vision API).
* ðŸ”„ Detect:
  * Rotated/mirrored components
  * Missing parts
  * Soldering defects

### âœ… User Interface (IMPLEMENTED)

* âœ… Modern dark-mode PySide6 desktop application
* âœ… Live camera preview with webcam integration
* âœ… One-click "Capture Front" / "Capture Back"
* âœ… One-click "Inspect Board" (UI ready, backend pending)
* âœ… Board selection dropdown with smart recognition
* âœ… Result summary with status updates
* âœ… Auto-save QA samples when both images captured
